# WebScrapers
This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks written in python for scraping data from websites and creating a csv file from it.

Scrapes data from a website and parses it into a csv file. This script is based on the PH tutorial *Intro to Beautiful Soup* by Jeri Wieringa (for getting data from one page) and the BetterProgramming Tutorial *How to Scrape Multiple Pages of a Website Using a Python Web Scraper* by Angelica Dietzel (for getting data from multiple pages). 

Documentations for *Beautiful Soup* can be found here: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#find-all
The website that I'm scraping in this example is: Lexikon Japans Studierende provided by the Staatsbibliothek Berlin: https://themen.crossasia.org/japans-studierende/index/show
It is a database that lists the names of Japanese students who studied abroad at German universities and other higher education institutions from 1868â€“1914.
